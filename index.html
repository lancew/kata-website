          The system provides a central server, that you access via a web
          browser. Multiple users can use the system at the same time. This
          includes organisers, judges and competitors. The system has been built
          to increase the ease at which an event can be organised and run, and
          to provide the basis to provide additional features to an audience.
          For example TV Graphics overlays for live video stream, live results
          to websites and big screens at venue, etc.

          The software is currently able to support IJF Kata format events only,
          extension to support local formats (BritishJudo for example) is
          planned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently (May 2022) I am looking for test events to confirm
          functionality is parallel with any existing systems. Please contact me
          (<a href="mailto:lw@judococh.com">Lance Wicks</a>) if you are
          interested.

          The system is currently written in Perl, using a SQLlite database and
          AlmondCSS for the web style. Mojolicious is the web framework
          providing a simple MVC model to work within. The code is currently
          under active development on a volunteer basis and is hosted on GitHub
          (privately currently).
        </p>
        <p>
          The system may migrate to Go-lang for the portability and single
          binary file for distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers interested in helping, please contact me and I would love
          to help you contribute to this AGPL software project (The code is not
          currently open to all as I don't consider it "ready").
